<h1>You and Your Career</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The unexamined life is not worth living</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve not listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw">You and Your Research</a> by Richard Hamming, I highly recommend it—you can also read the transcript <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">here</a>. Hamming&rsquo;s talk emphasises the importance of examining your career and the choices you make. Whilst the talk specifically speaks about research, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to draw parallels to software engineering—you only have one life, so why not do significant work?</p>

<p>Hamming doesn&rsquo;t define significant work, nor will I—it&rsquo;s deeply personal and varies for each individual. Instead, he outlines traits he&rsquo;s seen in others that have accomplished significant work.</p>

<ol>
<li>Doing significant work often involves an element of luck, but as Hamming puts it, &lsquo;luck favours the prepared mind&rsquo;. Being in the right place at the right time will only matter if you have the knowledge or skills to execute. Creating opportunities is important but wasted if you aren&rsquo;t ready to perform. Conversely, having the ability to perform but no opportunities can feel just as futile. The key lies in striking a balance—cultivating both readiness and the conditions where luck can find you.</li>
<li>Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest—consistent effort applied over time leads to exponential growth. In a field as vast as software, even a surface-level awareness of an idea can prove valuable when the time comes to use it, while deeper understanding builds expertise. Mastering the fundamentals is crucial; they are learned once and applied repeatedly in various contexts.</li>
<li>Maintain enough self-belief to persist, but enough self-awareness to recognise and adapt to mistakes. Software is more akin to an art than a science—there are no perfect solutions, only trade-offs. Success often lies in minimising the disadvantages rather than chasing absolutes.</li>
<li>To do important work, focus on important problems. What do you care about deeply? How can you work to address it? The answer is personal, but I think there’s great importance is reflecting on it, even if the answer changes.<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>These aren&rsquo;t all the points Hamming raises, but they are some of the points that stuck with me; I highly recommend listening to the talk yourself so that you may draw your own conclusions.</p>

<p>The average career is only 80,000 hours, so spend it well.</p>
